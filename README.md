**Deprecated**

This was a fun idea that stalled a while ago. There is not enough usable code top justify resurrecting this project.

The idea is simple, it needs a schema for accounts and recipes.  The rest can be served easily. Anyone is welcome
to take everything in this repository.

## Running

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
